      <p style="margin-top:40px">HTML is the dominant mark-up language for webpages, meaning hypertext mark-up language (HyperText Markup Language, </p>
      Culture language: hypertext mark-up language, hypertext mark-up language). HTML provides a way to create structural documents with links, quotations and other items, as well as to represent structural meanings for texts such as titles, paragraphs, and lists. It can then be used to embed images and objects and create interactive forms. HTML is written in the form of HTML elements, which are "tags" surrounded by angle brackets within the content of a web page. HTML can include or call up scripts such as CSS that define the appearance and placement of JavaScript and body parts and other items that affect the behavior of HTML processing devices, such as Web browsers. W3C, co-director of HTML and CSS standards, recommends the use of CSS for clear and superficial markups.
